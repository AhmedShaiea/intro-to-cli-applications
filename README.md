# Intro to CLI Applications

## An Introduction to Command Line Interface Applications

Command Line Applications (aka CLI applications or simply CLIs - for Command Line Interface) are programs that you interact with entirely through your terminal and shell. They have no graphics or visual interface beyond what you see in your terminal after you run the program. They don't have drop-down navigations for you to browse or anything at all for you to click on. They can only communicate to the user through ASCII output and only accept input from the user via ASCII characters entered into a prompt.

For example:

As you can see, a CLI application has a seemingly crude interface that implies limited potential and functionality for the end user. The truth is that CLI applications birthed the software revolution. 

> "Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.” Douglas McIlroy, creator of UNIX Operating System

Their simple interface and constrained features actually allowed people totally unfamiliar with computers or programming to interact with a machine. We wouldn't be where we are today without CLI applications.

As a developer, some of the most powerful tools you use are CLI applications. `git` is a CLI application. `learn` is a CLI application. The `ruby` interpreter is presented as a CLI application and interface.

Get excited about building CLI applications. They seem trivial and probably won't impress your friends, but they are the foundations of software and your first step in your journey to change the world through code.

### Bonus: A Bit About Strings

The string based input/output interface of CLI applications is the embodiment of one of the most profound realizations of the 20th century. There is only information, bits, 0s and 1s. We encode data in strings. Always. There are no pictures or jpgs, just text characters that describe the data that composes the image, the color of each pixel. There are no songs or MP3s, just 0s and 1s that describe the properties of the waves we hear. 

Even our own self, our very being, is represented as a sequence of characters. The DNA code is a sequence of base pairs that always bond with A-C, T-G, C-A, or G-T. You could describe a DNA sequence in data as the order and type of bonding. Our DNA is a literal code - a sequence of instructions for all of life, for every living thing that has ever been on this planet. The DNA code is encoded by biology but those base-pairs just represent data.
